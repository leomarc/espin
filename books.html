      </figure>
      <p>Responding to the flux of migration that has swept across the globe, this authoritative and dynamic collection of scholarship aims to address the question: What about the women? The chapters explain why women's experiences of migration are necessary and worthy of scholarly feminist psychological attention, examining women's experiences in and of themselves, not simply as members of a family unit. With topics including memory, language, work, violence, motherhood, and intergenerational impacts of migration, this collection provides a feminist analytical lens through which not only gender, but its intersections with race, ethnicity, class, age, culture, sexuality and other socio-historical/context factors are brought into clearer focus. Accessible to a wide readership, this unique body of scholarship extends and complicates existing conversations on migration.</p>

Chapters focus on the intersecting principles of feminism and multiculturalism, providing a much needed contribution to the field, with topics including domestic violence, eating disorders and body image, addictive behaviours, sexuality, immigrant and refugee experiences, and balancing the multiple roles of work and family.</p>

      <h3><a name="women-crossing"></a>Women Crossing Boundaries: The Psychology of Immigration and the Transformations of Sexuality, Routledge, 1999</h3>

        <img src="images/cover-women-crossing.jpg" width="170" height="255" border="0" alt="Women Crossing Boundaries: A Psychology of Immigration and Transformations of Sexuality">
      </figure>
      <p>Should a migrant community preserve its original culture at the expense of women's individuality or transform its attitude towards gender in ways that challenge age old traditions? Women Crossing Boundaries focuses on the impact of the process of migration on the development of sexuality and gender roles for women. Based on extensive research and interviews, the book presents the life narratives of immigrant and refugee women from Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caribbean. Ranging in age from the early 20s to the mid-70s, they discuss the development of their sexuality in the context of their home culture and the acculturation process demanded by their new country. At this time of massive transcultural migrations, this volume provides a valuable, in-depth exploration of women's perspectives on the immigrant experience.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Oliva Espin slices the standard immigration story with the sharp analytic blades of gender, sexuality, and language. <b>Women Crossing Boundaries</b> introduces us to the biographies of 43 adolescent and adult women who speak with shared grace, strength, and complexity, but with distinct points of tragedy and possibility. Espin expands our understanding as she releases our imaginations for what immigrant women's lives have been and might be."</p>
        <p align="right">--Michelle Fine<br> Professor of Social/Personality Psychology, City University of New York Graduate School and University Center
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"What becomes of women's sense of themselves as sexual beings, as laborers, as tellers of life stories when they immigrate? Espin provides original and compassionate responses to these questions and shows us that border crossings always have consequences for women--for their dreams and their desires."</p>
        <p align="right">--Ruth Behar<br> Professor of Anthropology, University of Michigan
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"In <b>Women Crossing Boundaries</b> we are treated to a marvelous array of stories of women's immigration to the United States. The women represented in this volume were born in different cultures and countries, immigrated at different ages, and have different sexual orientations. Nevertheless, even as she examines these differences, Espin shows how broadly and deeply gender and sexuality are implicated in women's experiences of this profound life change. A benchmark volume in the study of immigration and of women's lives!"</p>

      </figure>
      <p> A retrospective of 15 years, this book brings together for the first time, Oliva Espin's previously published articles and conference papers. Primarily focusing on the experiences of Latina women, gleaned from psychotherapy practice and research, the book presents discussions on experience as a source of theory and method in psychology, issues relevant to immigrant women and girls, and similar topics.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Oliva Espin gives a powerful voice to the stories of Latina immigrants. From understanding the experience of migration to the social construction of identity to the issues of sexuality, Espin provides an excellent framework for understanding the strengths and limitations of feminist approaches to psychotherapy for Latinas. This work is a testament to the collective power and strength of Latinas in crossing more than just physical borders and boundaries--it intimately speaks to the psychological, social, spiritual, political, and practical realities experienced by Latina women."</p>
        <p align="right">--Richard A. Rodriguez<br>University of California at Berkeley</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Oliva Espin poses questions that others have evaded in feminist psychology and ethnic studies. She gives answers based on years of experience as a teacher, therapist, and researcher. Espin speaks in a voice that clearly evokes and distills significant experiences of migration for Latinas and other women of color in the U.S. I find her work equally compelling whether I approach it as a Puerto Rican reader or as an academic interested in the psychological experiences of Latinas."</p>
        <p align="right">--Angela B. Ginorio<br>Northwest Center for Research on Women</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"With this collection of her writings, Oliva Espin's work will finally receive the visibility that it has so long deserved. Hers is an essential voice through which psychologists and scholars can hear the nuances of a complex, fully envisioned feminist theory."</p>

        <p>"<b>Latina Healers</b> casts new light on the centrality of gender and migration status on the lives of Latina women. Encompassing the idiosyncrasies of individual decisions and the social context of the healers' lives, this book presents an original analysis of the relationship between gender, power, religious beliefs and social status. It brings the scholarship on life narratives together with understanding of the impact of migration and traditional beliefs on the lives of these women. Heralding women not as passive victims of social forces, but as active and creative agents of their lives, the book's findings are valuable for mental health practitioners, feminist scholars, and all interested in the lives of Latinas."</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Dr. Oliva Espin social research and most inquisitive biographical narrative provide a solid new interpretation of the roles of healers in the Latino community. Drawn from historical and traditional beliefs, a new understanding of power between genders is herein clearly documented. Highly recommended."</p>

        <img src="images/cover-sin-salvation.jpg" alt="Sin or Salvation: The Relationship Between Sexuality and Spirituality in Psychotherapy" border="0"> 
      </figure>
      <p>A unique feminist exploration of the interplay of two topics of crucial psychological importance.</p>
      <p>When in therapy, women inevitably present both sexual and spiritual issues of importance. However, there has yet to be brought forth an integrating approach to the understanding of women's sexuality and spirituality from a feminist psychological perspective. Sin or Salvation: The Relationship Between Sexuality and Spirituality in Psychotherapy fills this gap, integrating these two diverse yet still connected aspects of therapy. This innovative exploration of women's experiences of their sexuality and spirituality is presented from a feminist psychological perspective, clearly illustrating the dichotomy that exists in Western culture and offering a unique approach for convergence. This book provides therapists with positive and self-affirming viewpoints and practical strategies to help harmonize sex and spirit issues in women clients.</p>
      <p><b>Sin or Salvation: The Relationship Between Sexuality and Spirituality in Psychotherapy</b> uses a synergistic perspective to facilitate healing for women's psycho/sexual/spiritual growth and development. Therapists are provided with invaluable tools for personal understanding and clinical practice when considering sexuality and spirituality and how they interact in a client's life.</p>
