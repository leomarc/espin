<p><a name="spiritual"></a>WOMEN AS SPIRITUAL TEACHERS (WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON CATHOLIC WOMEN SAINTS)</p>
<p>Fall 1998 </p>
<p>Course Description: This course draws widely from the voices of women mystics and spiritual teachers, on history and mythology, and on feminist theory and the psychology of women. Exploration of historical, cultural, and political contexts of sainthood and perceptions of holiness for women. Particular emphasis will be placed on Roman Catholic women saints as a case study. Focus on common and dissimilar psychological processes among the women and on their resistance and accommodation to normative women's roles. Study of the lives and writings of Latin American, North American, and selected European women saints. Feminist and psychological analyses of their narratives and of hagiographic and critical analyses of their lives.</p>

<p><a name="latin"></a>WOMEN OF LATIN AMERICA</p>
<p>Fall 1998 </p>
<p>Course Description: This course will survey the interplay of social change processes (e.g., historical/political events) and other factors (e.g., race, class, ethnicity, religion and gender) in the lives of Latin American women. The course analyzes the particularities and intersections of multiple forms of oppression and liberation, (e.g., political circumstances, gender, race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientation) that affect the lives of women in Latin America, and assesses the various theoretical frameworks which have been advanced in understanding their situation. </p>
<p>The focus of the course will be on discovering the voices and the life experiences of women from a variety of cultural backgrounds and Latin American countries in order to understand the diversity and the commonality of the social histories that have produced those voices. Particular emphasis will be placed on the influence of socio-cultural perspectives in the construction of possible life narratives for women. We will rely heavily on a theoretical frame provided by narrative studies. This perspective focuses on the role narratives and life stories play in the formation of identity, on the cultural conditions that may constrain of facilitate the development of such narratives, and on the effect that critical insight and engagement may have on the transformation of stories and narratives. The individual desire and the societal possibilities both push the limits and constrain the boundaries of the lived story. We will look at the effect societal transformations have on the stories told, both theoretically and personally, and on the liberatory and transformative consequences of new stories for the development of Latin American women's lives.</p>

<p><a name="race"></a> WOMEN, RACE, AND CLASS</p>
<p>Spring 1998</p>
<p> Course Description: This course will survey the interplay of race, class, ethnicity and gender in the lives of women, with particular emphasis on the experience of women of color in the United States. The course analyzes the particularities and intersections of multiple forms of oppression, specifically gender, race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientation, and assesses the various theoretical frameworks which have been advanced in understanding the oppression of women of color and women in the "Third World." The focus of the course will be on discovering the voices and the life experiences of women from a variety of cultural backgrounds in order to understand the diversity and the commonality of the social histories that have produced those voices. Particular emphasis will be placed on the influence of socio-cultural perspectives in the construction of possible life narratives for women. We will rely heavily on a theoretical frame provided by narrative studies. This perspective focuses on the role narratives and life stories play in the formation of identity, on the cultural conditions that may constrain or facilitate the development of such narratives, and on the effect that critical insight and engagement may have on the transformation of stories and narratives.</p>
<p>Stories lived and stories told are influenced by what is culturally acceptable. Not only acceptable behavior but also acceptable accounts of behavior are regulated by society. When societal transformations occur, the acceptable accounts are also transformed. The individual desire and the societal possibilities both push the limits and constrain the boundaries of the lived story. We will look at the effect societal transformations have on the stories told, both theoretically and personally, and on the liberatory and transformative consequences of new stories for the development of women's identity and possible lives.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGE AND OPPRESSION: GENDER, ETHNICITY, RACE AND CLASS IN WOMEN'S LIVES </p>
<p> Course Description:This course will survey and analyze the particularities and intersections of multiple forms of oppression and privilege, specifically gender, race, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, and their implications for theory development in feminist psychology. The workshop will provide a conceptual frame for the psychology of all women from the perspective of experiences of privilege and oppression. The focus of the course will be on how privilege and oppression have been internalized and expressed in the life experiences of women from different backgrounds in order to understand the diversity and commonality of the social histories that have shaped or repressed their voices.</p>
